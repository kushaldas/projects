# GUI to encrypt USB drives


## Abstract / Purpose 

We need a GUI application which can help any newbie user to encrypt
their USB drives without knowing anything technical knowledge
behind. This will help our users to encrypt random USB drives we use,
and if they get misplaced, we can have certain amount of *peace of
mind* about the data in the drives.


### Description

The user will select the USB drive from the dropdown menu, and then
also add a long password (twice), and the USB drive will be LUKS
encrtypted.  We should show the warning that this will delete any
existing data in the drive. The warning must be very visible.
